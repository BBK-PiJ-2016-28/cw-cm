Please look at the general comments to see if any apply.

The structure of the repository doesn't adhere to the recommended
gradle/maven structure which has made the code awkward to test
and review. Please adhere to the recommended structure going 
forward.

Package names should be in lowercase.

We would like to have seen a more indepth set of tests.

You should add javadoc for private fields and methods.

Output is not desirable and exceptions would be preferable.
If you must use output send it to the console using System.err 
rather than System.out.

Was there any need to provide a no-arg constructor for 
PastMeetingImpl?

Why are you using iterators rather than using a foreach structure?
Make appropriate use of the language constructs going forward 
(that also applies to Java 8 facilities).

The idea with the persistence was to dump to a file on request and
on closing the system not at each situation when items are "added" 
or modified.

The amount of output in your classes is unnecessary and unwanted. 
Someone else using your classes just wants to know the result of 
the method call and would probably not want your output in their
application. 

There are similarities in the codebase that could have been 
refactored out and would definitely benefit from using Java 8 
constructs (that is going forward).

The persistence should go to one file by making the CMimpl 
serialisable rather than using several files and persistence 
structures.

Good attempt. Pass/Merit.
